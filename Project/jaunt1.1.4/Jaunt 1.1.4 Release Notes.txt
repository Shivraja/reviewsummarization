CHANGES:

enhancement: method UserAgent.download(String url, File file) now accepts ftp urls.
enhancement: method HttpResponse.getHeader(String name) now treats the name parameter as case-insensitive.
enhancement: if flag UserAgentSettings.showHeaders is enabled, response status code is now shown as well as headers.
enhancement: method Document.saveCompleteWebPage(String url) is more efficient and now generates a JSON manifest of downloaded items which is avaiable via UserAgent.json. 
bugfix: Document.saveCompleteWebPage was not applying userAgentSettings to all download threads, and ResponseExceptions were being incorrectly generated when frames pointed directly to non-html/xtml content-items. 
bugfix: base-urls that contained a querystring ending with "/" were incorrectly handled by parser when creating absolute urls.
bugfix: UserAgent was failing to handle cookies during redirects for status code 3xx.
bugfix: method Document.saveCompleteWebPage was in some cases generating ConcurrentModificationException
bugfix: Cookies.saveCookies(File) was generating serialization error.
bugfix: UserAgentSettings.autosaveAsHTML eas erroneously saving HTML files as ".xml" for POST requests.
bugFix: UserAgentSettings.maxbytes value was being erroneously shared between UserAgent instances.
bugFix: UserAgent.sendPOST was generating an error when posting a queryString that did not contain '='.

change: serialVersionUID was added to all serializable classes.
